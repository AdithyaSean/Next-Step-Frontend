## Dividing Microservices for Next Step Project

Here's a breakdown of how we can divide our application into microservices following best practices:

**Microservices:**

1. **User Management Service:**
    - Handles user registration, login, authentication, and authorization.
    - This service can be independent with its own database for user data.

2. **Student Profile Service:**
    - Manages student profiles, including basic information, academic results, interests, skills, and career predictions.
    - This service can access data from User Management and other relevant services.

3. **Education Data Service:**
    - Provides information about universities, streams, courses, and careers.
    - This service can have a separate database and APIs for fetching details. 

4. **Recommendation Engine Service:**
    - Core AI functionality, analyzes student data, retrieves relevant educational data and generates career path recommendations with probabilities.
    - This service can be a separate microservice consuming data from User Management, Student Profile, and Education Data services.

5. **Frontend Service:**
    - React application acts as the user interface, fetching data and displaying recommendations from various microservices through APIs.

**Benefits of this approach:**

* **Improved Scalability:** Each service can be scaled independently based on its load.
* **Loose Coupling:** Services are loosely coupled, changes in one service don't affect others significantly.
* **Faster Development:** Teams can work on different services concurrently.
* **Technology Flexibility:** Different services can use different programming languages and databases.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **API Gateway:** Implement an API Gateway to manage requests and route them to the appropriate microservices.
* **Data Consistency:**  Use asynchronous communication and eventually consistent data patterns to manage data updates across services.
* **Monitoring & Logging:** Implement monitoring and logging for each service to troubleshoot potential issues.

**Alternative Approach:**

While the above is a good starting point, you might consider combining Student Profile and Education Data into a single service depending on the size and complexity of the data. This can simplify architecture for smaller projects.

**Remember:**

* Start with clear boundaries between services based on functionalities.
* Refine your architecture as your application evolves.

By following these guidelines, you can create a well-structured and maintainable microservices architecture for your educational path recommendation system.
