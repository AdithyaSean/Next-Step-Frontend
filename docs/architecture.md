# Next Step - Complete System Architecture

## System Overview

Next Step is built using a microservices architecture, with each service handling specific domain responsibilities while maintaining its own data store. The system is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and flexible.

## Microservices Architecture

### 1. User Management Service
- **Responsibility**: Handles user authentication, authorization, and user data management
- **Key Entities**:
  ```java
  @Entity
  public class User {
      private UUID id;
      private String name;
      private String email;
      private String password;
      private String role;
  }
  ```
- **Database**: Dedicated user database
- **Key APIs**:
  - User registration
  - Authentication
  - User profile management

### 2. Student Profile Service
- **Responsibility**: Manages comprehensive student data and academic profiles
- **Key Entities**:
  ```java
  @Entity
  public class Student {
      private UUID id;
      private String contact;
      private String school;
      private String district;
      private Map<String, String> olResults;
      private Map<String, String> alResults;
      private String stream;
      private Double zScore;
      private String university;
      private String course;
      private Double gpa;
      private List<String> interests;
      private List<String> skills;
      private List<String> strengths;
      private List<CareerPrediction> predictions;
  }
  ```
- **Database**: Student profile database
- **Dependencies**: User Management Service
- **Key APIs**:
  - Student profile CRUD operations
  - Academic results management
  - Skills and interests updates

### 3. Education Data Service
- **Responsibility**: Manages educational institution and course data
- **Key Entities**:
  ```java
  @Entity
  public class Stream {
      private UUID id;
      private String name;
      private List<String> requiredOLSubjects;
      private Map<String, String> minimumOLGrades;
      private List<Course> possibleCourses;
      private List<String> relatedCareers;
  }

  @Entity
  public class Course {
      private UUID id;
      private String name;
      private String duration;
      private Map<String, String> minimumALGrades;
      private Double minimumZScore;
      private List<Institution> offeredBy;
      private List<String> relatedCareers;
  }

  @Entity
  public class Institution {
      private UUID id;
      private String name;
      private String type;
      private String website;
      private List<Course> courses;
  }

  @Entity
  public class Career {
      private String code;
      private String title;
      private String category;
      private List<String> requiredSkills;
      private List<String> relatedCourses;
  }
  ```
- **Database**: Educational data database
- **Key APIs**:
  - Stream and course information
  - Institution details
  - Career path data

### 4. Recommendation Engine Service
- **Responsibility**: Core AI functionality for career predictions
- **Features**:
  - Student data analysis
  - Career path recommendation
  - Probability calculations
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Student Profile Service
  - Education Data Service
- **Key APIs**:
  - Generate career recommendations
  - Update prediction models
  - Fetch career insights

### 5. Frontend Service
- **Responsibility**: User interface and client-side logic
- **Technology**: React application
- **Features**:
  - Responsive UI
  - Data visualization
  - Real-time updates
- **Dependencies**: All other services via API Gateway

## System Integration

### API Gateway
- Routes requests to appropriate microservices
- Handles authentication and authorization
- Implements rate limiting and security measures

### Inter-Service Communication
- REST APIs for synchronous operations
- Message queues for asynchronous operations
- Event-driven architecture for data consistency

### Data Consistency
- Eventually consistent model
- Each service maintains its own database
- Cross-service data synchronization through events

## Security Architecture

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- API-level security
- Data encryption at rest and in transit

## Monitoring and Logging

- Centralized logging system
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting
- Service health checks

## Deployment Architecture

- Containerized services using Docker
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- Scalable cloud infrastructure
- CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments

## Best Practices

1. **Service Independence**
   - Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently
   - Loose coupling between services
   - Clear service boundaries

2. **Data Management**
   - Each service owns its data
   - No direct database access between services
   - Data replication when necessary

3. **Fault Tolerance**
   - Circuit breakers for service calls
   - Fallback mechanisms
   - Retry policies

4. **Scalability**
   - Horizontal scaling of services
   - Load balancing
   - Caching strategies

## Future Considerations

1. **Service Mesh Implementation**
   - Enhanced service-to-service communication
   - Better traffic management
   - Improved observability

2. **Machine Learning Pipeline**
   - Dedicated ML service
   - Model training infrastructure
   - Real-time prediction capabilities

3. **Analytics Service**
   - User behavior tracking
   - System usage analytics
   - Performance metrics
